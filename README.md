Latin America countries are undergoing major changes in the mortality profile because of the peculiarities of epidemiological and health transitions in the region. The main goal of this paper is to study the evolution of the mortality age profile and the distribution of age at death for a series of Latin America countries. The paper investigates the evolution of the distribution of deaths over age and time in order to identify the effects of changes on the variability of age at death. We use data from different and alternative sources (WHO, LAHMD, and LAMBdA) to study this issue in the region. We evaluate the quality of data that underlie national-level mortality overtime in Latin American countries. Using a relation model we estimate a single age pattern of mortality for Latin America. And lastly, we use traditional metrics of age at death variability to perform the analysis. The results indicate that the quality of mortality data is improving over time for all countries included. We also find a reduction in variability of age at death, and that the reduction was faster for females than males. In recent years, increasing mortality levels by external causes of deaths related to violence, reduce the rise in life expectancy and birth and increased the variability in the age at death for several countries in the region. The paper contributes to the study of mortality changes in Latin America looking and compression and the variability of age at death. Over the last half-century there was a reduction in the variability age at death, but recent increases in external causes of death are related to an stagnation of the compression process. The analysis also provides some insights and questions about the morbidity process in the region.
